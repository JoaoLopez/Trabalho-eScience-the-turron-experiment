## Summary
## Introduction

Altough EMBO is a scientific organisation, not all staff comes from a scientific background. We did this experiment as part of a **learning exercise to get acquainted with concepts like experimental design, data collection, data analysis and reporting**. We were convinced that forcing ourselves to do as realistic an experiment as possible would give us the biggest learning outcome. 

Since we had 2 turrón varieties of the same kind but of very different prices at hand, we reasoned that it would be a 'fun' experiment to **have EMBO staff try to differentiate those 2 varieties from each other simply by a series of parameters, including taste, texture, and visual appearance**. 

Turrón variety #1 ('expensive_turrón' or 'turrón_A') cost 5x as much as turrón variety #2 ('cheap_turrón' or 'turrón_B'). We designed a simple experiment in which volunteers would taste both turrón varieties and then be asked to fill in a questionnaire. They scored both turrones on parameters 'texture', 'visual appearace', 'taste', 'sweetness' and 'overall score'. Our aim with these questions was to collect information that would help us evaluate whether subjects had a preference for turrón A or turrón B. 

In addition to turrón-related parameters, we also asked participants to answer the following questions: 

* Which of the 2 turrones do you think is the expensive one? - This question would allow us to analyse guess accuracy and coherence between turrón scoring and guess. It was also a great motivator to engage participants, as they were presented with a challenge.
* Was this the first time you tasted turrón? - This would allow us to separate groups into naive vs. non-naive participants and evauate whether previous experience had any effect on turrón scoring or on the accuracy of the guess.
* How many hours ago did you last eat? - This question would allow us to analyse a possible correlation between fasting time and turrón scoring or accuracy of guess. 

We also noted the gender of each participant on their questionnaire to analyse any possible gender:scoring or gender:accuracy interactions.

We observed only **minor differences in scoring for visual, texture, sweetness and taste parameters between both turrón varieties despite the price difference**. In general the range of scoring was very similar between both turrón varieties, with very few low or high scores. Female participants tended to score higher for both turrones in visual and texture parameters. 

Interestingly, **participants that had already tasted turrón before** (i.e. they were non-naive) **had a higher success rate in guessing the expensive turrón**. They also scored turrón_A higher than turrón_B in several parameters. 

All in all, it was a useful experiment to learn the basics of experimental design, data collection, analysis and representation. Our sample size was too small to draw any solid conclusions but our observations suggest that **a random sample of people would not be able to distinguish the expensive from the cheap turrón in a blind tasting**. 

<!-- So, in conclusion: you do not need to spend the money on an expensive turrón, the cheap one will do just as well...  -->





<!-- * Why did we do this?
* Motivation
* Why not the tea lady tasting -->

## Limitations

* number of subjects
* lack of independance
* material shortage
* time constraint / personal circumstances
* some questions not well formulated (e.g. sweetness)
* expectations
    * small group
    * score very similar in between turróns

## Experimental design

* logic for data collection
* questions

###  Data collection


## Results

* turrón A vs B
* gender general effect
* turrón:gender
* turrón:first_time_tasting
* coherence analysis
* correlation with fasting

* Missing data (and how to handle)

## Discussion

* In context with other similar or related analysis
* Refer to the yoguhrt experiment
* Better questions (e.g. the 'sweetness' parameter invalidated because some people scored which one was sweeter and others scored which of the 2 they liked better for sweetness)

## Conclusions

* most people have breakfast bw 7-9am
* some people cannot process information on our ballots
